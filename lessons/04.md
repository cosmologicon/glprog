# Lesson 04

This lesson is about what happens when a fragment (i.e. pixel) is covered by more than one shape.

In 2D graphics, in order to draw a scene, you sort your objects by z-index and just draw them on top
of each other. In 3D graphics, this is, in general, much harder, because you need to deal with
complex shapes in many different orientations.

It would be nice if there was a way for fragments that come out of the fragment shader to be sorted
before being applied to the framebuffer. But for whatever reason, this is not possible. The
fragments are applied in the order they're called. So you must rely on another tool: depth testing.

The depth buffer
===============

In a framebuffer (like the viewport), there are three kinds of buffers: the color buffer, the depth
buffer, and the stencil buffer. (The stencil buffer is useful for a few effects like portals and
shadows, but it's kind of advanced, so I won't be covering it.) Each buffer contains values for each
fragment in the framebuffer. The color buffer is easy to understand. It contains the rgba values of
the colors you actually see in the viewport. You don't view the contents of the depth buffer
directly, but it's there too.

So what does the depth buffer contain, and how does it help? It contains a value from 0 to 1 for
each fragment, that represents the distance from the viewer of the surface covering that fragment.
0 is nearest and 1 is farthest. The depth buffer is cleared at the same time as the color buffer if
you specify both when you call:

	gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | gl.DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT)

The value that it's claered to can be set with `gl.clearDepth`, but the default value of 1 is almost
always what you want.

Standard depth testing
======================

When a new surface is being written to that fragment, WebGL performs depth testing, and only updates
the fragment if the new depth is less than the old depth (ie, the new object is closer to the viewer
than the existing object). When this happens, the depth buffer is also updated with the new
fragment's depth value.

How is a fragment's depth determined? It's from the z-component of `gl_Position`. Objects will
appear in the viewport if `gl_Position.z` is between -1 and 1, and this value will be mapped to the
range [0, 1] to fill the depth buffer.

That's the standard behavior, anyway. There are a number of settings that affect exactly whether and
how depth testing happens. To get the standard behavior, use the following:

	gl.enable(gl.DEPTH_TEST)
	gl.depthFunc(gl.LESS)

The depth function is the criterion that a fragment must have in order to pass the depth test and be
drawn to the viewport. `gl.LESS` means it passes the depth test if its `gl_Position.z` value (and
therefore its depth) is less than what's already written to the depth buffer. There are other
options like `gl.GREATER` that are used rarely for certain special effects.

It's also possible to keep depth testing on, but not update the depth buffer when a new fragment is
added, by turning off the depth mask:

	gl.depthMask(false)

This may be useful in rare situations.

Blending
========

So, if a fragment passes the depth test and gets written to the framebuffer, whatever was there
before is thrown out, right? Not necessarily. Blending is the process of taking into account both
the current value in the color buffer (destination) and the incoming value (source) to get the new
value. It's how WebGL implements semi-transparent surfaces. It's off by default, so if you have any
transparency in your scene, enable it with:

	gl.enable(gl.BLEND)

There are a huge number of possible blending functions that take into account the alpha value of the
source and destination fragments. The one you want is this:

	gl.blendFuncSeparate(gl.SRC_ALPHA, gl.ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA, 0, 1)

This is a WebGL-specific recommendation. Other OpenGL tutorials will recommend a combined blending
function rather than this separate one. The reason for the distinction is the alpha channel of the
canvas itself. If OpenGL is running in a program window, it doesn't matter what the alpha channel
ends up being, as long as the rgb values are correct. In WebGL, the framebuffer is part of a web
page, and if it winds up being transparent, the page background will show through. The separated
blending function above ensures that if you set the alpha channel to 1 initially when you call
`gl.clear`, it will always remain 1 no matter what else you draw on it.

Anyway, the line above corresponds to the blending function:

	red(new) = red(source) x alpha(source) + red(destination) x (1 - alpha(source))

and similarly for the green and blue channels. This is the intuitive meaning of the alpha channel
that most people have. Again, some unusual effects call for a different formula.

An alternative is using the standard, non-separated blending function, and disabling the alpha color
mask:

	gl.blendFunc(gl.SRC_ALPHA, gl.ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)
	gl.colorMask(true, true, true, false)

This will prevent any new fragment from updating the alpha values in the color buffer. The only
thing is that you need to have it enabled when you call `gl.clear` the first time, since the alpha
values default to `0.0`.

General recommendations
=======================

So now you know the standard settings for depth and blending:

	gl.enable(gl.DEPTH_TEST)
	gl.depthFunc(gl.LESS)
	gl.enable(gl.BLEND)
	gl.blendFuncSeparate(gl.SRC_ALPHA, gl.ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA, 0, 1)

This is really what you almost always want. This corresponds to the fourth column of points in the
lesson. But, if you look closely, you can see it's not perfect. It shows exactly what you want for
the solid opaque points at the top, with red in front and yellow and blue in back. But look at the
transparent points. The white stripe comes through roughly as you expect, but you should also be
able to see some of the yellow behind the red, and some of the blue behind the red and yellow. It
gets worse as you go down. By the time you get the bottom with 25% opacity, you really ought to be
able to see some of the background colors. In my opinion, columns 5, 6, and 8, although not perfect
themselves, look better on the bottom row.

This problem would go away if we had properly sorted the surfaces by depth, and drawn the farthest
point (blue) first, and the nearest (red) last. Then several of the columns, including column 4,
would look exactly right.

So what's the solution? There's no perfect one, but here are my general recommendations:

If you don't have any alpha transparency in your scene, great. Use the standard depth settings,
and you can disable blending altogether. You're done. Otherwise use the standard depth and blending
settings.

Try to separate out your solid and transparent surfaces. Draw your solid ones first and your
transparent ones last.

If you can sort your transparent surfaces by depth, it's probably worth it. If you have transparent
surfaces that you can't sort by depth, use the standard settings and try disabling the depth mask
(column 8) only while drawing transparent surfaces. Use your judgment as to whether that improves
the scene.

	gl.depthMask(false)

Getters used in this lesson
===========================

// Boolean: whether depth testing is enabled
gl.getParameter(gl.DEPTH_TEST)
// Number: number of bits in your depth buffer (at least 16)
gl.getParameter(gl.DEPTH_BITS)
// Array of 2 Numbers: range of the depth buffer to write to. Defaults to [0, 1]
gl.getParameter(gl.DEPTH_RANGE)
// Boolean: whether the depth mask is set to writeable
gl.getParameter(gl.DEPTH_WRITEMASK)
// Number: value that the depth buffer will be cleared to. Defaults to 1.
gl.getParameter(gl.DEPTH_CLEAR_VALUE)
// Number (enum): current setting of gl.depthFunc, e.g. gl.LESS.
gl.getParameter(gl.DEPTH_FUNC)

Exercises
=========

1. Change `drawpoints` so that the yellow point is on top when depth testing is enabled in column
4, but on bottom when depth testing is not enabled in column 5.
1. Change `drawcolumn` to make the bottom row always have an alpha value of 0. Guess before doing
this will actually have the bottom row not drawn.
1. Change `drawpoints` to make the blue point always be solid (alpha = 1). Guess what the bottom
row will look like in each case.
1. Change the depth func to `gl.GREATER` instead of `gl.LESS`. Again, guess what will happen.
