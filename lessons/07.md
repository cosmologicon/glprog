# Lesson 07

This lesson puts some finishing touches on the scene we built in Lessons 05 and 06.

Loops are one difference. `for` loops are allowed, but only if the compiler can determine the
number of iterations, and it's not too large. So `for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)` is fine. But more
complicated setups are not, and you can't modify `i` within the loop body. The reason for this is
that the compiler needs to be able to unroll the loop, as an optimization. In this case, it would
replace the loop with 10 copies of its body. When `for` loops are allowed, `break` and `continue`
work like in JavaScript. `while` and `do` loops are not supported.

You might be wondering how it's possible to make complicated 3D scenes with many objects if you
can't even use something as simple as `while` loops in the shaders. The whole idea behind the shader
pipeline is that the main things you would want to iterate over have already been broken out and
parallelized. In some sense, you can think of what goes in the shader as the inner body of a loop
already. The rest of the WebGL state determines how the iteration occurs. If that's not reassuring,
just trust that you'll get the hang of it eventually.



## Perspective transformation

Our scene looks pretty 3d, but it could look much better. For one thing, points don't get larger
when they're closer to the camera. The general topic of perspective, like lighting, is very
complicated, and linear algebra really comes in handy here. We're just going to do something simple.

The perspective transformation involves changing the position and the size of the points, so as you
may guess, this belongs in the vertex shader.

If you remember in the vertex shader, we've got something that expresses how far something is from
the viewer: `clippos.z`. This is equal to `-1.0` at the nearest point that's visible, and equal to
`1.0` at the farthest point that's visible. Let's say `clippos.z` is equal to `0.0` 


 We need a factor that expresses how far a point is
from the camera.

## `gl_FragCoord`

Now let's go back to the fragment shader, and do a couple more effects, just because we can.

Like `gl_PointCoord`, `gl_FragCoord` is a global value available to the fragment shader that varies
between fragments. It's a `mediump vec4` that gives this fragment's position in the viewport.
`gl_FragCoord.xy` is in pixels. For instance, if the viewport is 854x480 pixels, then
`gl_FragCoord.x` varies from 0 on the left edge to the viewport, to 854 on the right edge.
`gl_FragCoord.y` varies from 0 on the bottom edge, to 480 on the top. `gl_FragCoord.z` indicates the
fragment's depth. Its range is 0 (closest to the viewer) up to 1 (farthest from the viewer),
regardless of viewport size.

Many things you might think to do with `gl_FragCoord` can be better done with shader varyings, which
we'll cover in later lessons. But here we use it for two special effects.

First, we use `gl_FragCoord.z` to make things farther from the viewer appear darker, by multiplying
`color` by a value that depends on `gl_FragCoord.z`. (It's a bit subtle, but good effects often
are.) This was a common technique in older video games known as distance fog. Because you could only
render out to a limited distance, by default objects would suddenly appear and disappear as they
passed the distance barrier. So you smoothly blend the object's color into the background color as
it gets farther away, to make the transition less sudden. At any rate, this is as simple as:

	color *= 1.0 - gl_FragCoord.z;

Second, we use `gl_FragCoord.xy` to make a circle of inverted colors centered on the mouse cursor.
We pass in the mouse position from JavaScript as a uniform called `mpos`, and use the built-in
`distance` function to invert the color if this fragment's `gl_FragCoord.xy` is within 100 pixels of
`mpos`.

	if (distance(gl_FragCoord.xy, mpos) < 100.0) {
		color = 1.0 - color;
	}

## Exercises

1. Change the `0.7` in the definition of `pfactor` to other different values, and see which one you
like best. You can even try negative numbers if you want to see some strange perspectives.
1. Change the negative filter around the mouse cursor from a circle shape to a square shape. Hint:
the `abs` function will come in handy.
1. Disable depth testing. What do you think will happen?
1. Change the line that updates `color` based on `gl_FragCoord.z` to this:
`color = mix(color, background, gl_FragCoord.z);` This lets you fade out `color` to any background
color you want instead of just black. Try setting `background` to blue (`vec3(0.0, 0.0, 1.0)`).
Also update the `util.clear` line in the JavaScript so that the background color actually is blue.
1. Make it so that not every point gets the negative filter applied to it. Only apply the negative
filter if `mod(float(index.y), 2.0) == 0.0`, to get every other layer.
