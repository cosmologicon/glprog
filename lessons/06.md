# Lesson 06

This lesson continues building the scene from Lesson 05. In this lesson we'll see use some features
of the fragment shader to create rounded points and lighting.

## Built-in functions

GLSL has a bunch of handy built-in functions, useful for the kinds of things that you do in shaders
all the time. We've seen `sin` and `cos`, and we'll use a few more in this lesson. This section
contains a complete list, but of course you don't need to memorize them.

The following functions behave exactly like their `Math` counterparts in JavaScript:

	sin cos tan pow exp log sqrt abs floor ceil min max sign

Also `atan` is equivalent to JavaScript's `Math.atan2`, and `mod` is equivalent to JavaScript's `%`
operator. The following are additional useful math functions:

	degrees radians asin acos log2 inversesqrt fract

The following functions are convenient ways to handle values over a range. One of the most useful is
`clamp(x, a, b)`, which restricts the value of `x` to the range `[a, b]`. It's equivalent to
`x > a ? a : x < b ? b : x`, or `Math.min(Math.max(x, a), b)`:

	clamp mix step smoothstep

The following functions are for vectors operations. For instance `dot(a, b)` is the vector dot
product of the vectors `a` and `b`:

	length distance dot cross normalize faceforward reflect refract

The following are for component-wise operations on matrices and vectors. They don't come up as much.
`any` and `all` are similar to JavaScript's `Array.some` and `Array.every`, but not really as
useful:

	matrixCompMult lessThan lessThanEqual greaterThan greaterThanEqual equal notEqual any all not

Finally there are texture lookup functions, which we'll cover starting in lesson 08:

	texture2D texture2DProj texture2DLod texture2DProjLod
	textureCube textureCubeLod

## Rotation matrices

Coordinate transformations are represented by transformation matrices. When you multiply a vector by
a transformation matrix, you transform that vector into a different coordinate system. There are
matrices for translation (shifting), rotation, stretching and shrinking, and a few other things.

We're going to use matrices for rotation, and I'll stick to 2 dimensions to keep things simple. To
rotate a vector by an angle theta in 2 dimensions, multiply by the vector by the 2-d rotation
matrix:

	[ cos(theta)  sin(theta) ]
	[-sin(theta)  cos(theta) ]

This matrix is represented in GLSL with the type `mat2`:

	mat2(cos(theta), sin(theta), -sin(theta), cos(theta))

We're going to apply two rotations. First, rotate around the y (vertical) axis by an angle that
increases over time. This gives the effect of the cube of points spinning. Second, rotate around the
x (horizontal) axis by a fixed amount. This tilts the cube toward you, so that it looks like you're
looking down on it rather than from the side.

To rotate around the y axis, we multiply `gamepos.xz` by a rotation matrix. This updates the x and
z coordinates, but leaves the y coordinate fixed. To rotate around the x axis, we multiply
`gamepos.yz` by a rotation matrix, which updates y and z but leaves x fixed.

## Functions

The two matrices are created with a call to a function I defined called `R`. Given an angle, it
returns a rotation matrix by that angle:

	mat2 R(in float angle) {
		float S = sin(angle), C = cos(angle);
		return mat2(C, S, -S, C);
	}

The body of the function is similar to a JavaScript function, with a `return` value. It uses the
built-in functions `sin` and `cos`, which are the same as JavaScript's `Math.sin` and `Math.cos`.
However, the top line is a bit different. There's no keyword like `function`. Instead you need to
declare the return type (`mat2` in this case). There's a single argument, written as
`in float angle`. `float` is, of course, the type of the argument.

The `in` keyword is a bit unusual. There's nothing quite like it in JavaScript. Every function
argument in GLSL is either `in`, which means its value gets passed from outside the function into
the function (like in JavaScript), or `out`, which means its value goes from inside the function
out, or `inout`, which means it goes both ways. If you set an argument to `in`, then any changes
you make to that argument will not be reflected outside the function. But if you set it to `out` or
`inout`, they will be.

`in` is the default.



## `gl_PointCoord` and `discard`

In order for a point to appear as anything other than a solid square of color, we need different
fragments (aka pixels) in the same point to write different values to `gl_FragColor`. This is
impossible if the only thing we consider are uniforms, because uniforms have the same value for
every fragment in the point. So we need something other than uniforms.

The most common thing for this is shader varyings, which we'll see in lesson XX. But for this lesson
we'll use `gl_PointCoord`. This is a `mediump vec2`, a vector of 2 medium-precision floats, that
gives the (x,y) coordinate over the surface of the point. It ranges from (0, 0) in the upper left of
the point to (1, 1) in the lower right of the point. (Note that y = 0 on top, not bottom, in this
case. Usually it's the other way.)

Now, if we want to make the point into a sphere, we need to determine whether the fragment falls
within a circle centered on the center of the point. To make the math simpler, let's start by
transforming `gl_PointCoord` into a different coordinate system, with a vector I'll call `p`. This
vector ranges from (-1, -1) on the lower left of the point to (1, 1) on the upper right of the
point.

Now the circle in question is the unit circle, the formula for which is `p.x^2 + p.y^2 = 1`. We can
also use the hand built-in function `length`, in which case the formula is `length(p) = 1`. If the
fragment falls outside this circle, we don't want to assign it any color. We could accomplish this
by setting `gl_FragColor.a` to `0.0`, so the fragment will be completely transparent (assuming
appropriate blending settings). The better way is with the `discard` keyword:

	if (length(p) > 1.0) discard;

`discard` means that this fragment will not appear with any color, nor will it affect the depth
buffer, regardless of any depth or blending settings, and regardless of any value that has been
assigned to `gl_FragColor`. This is exactly what we want.

And just like that, we've got a circle.

## Lighting

Let's see this shader actually do some shading. Lighting is an enormous topic, with many physical
models and equations that are used to replicate many different kinds of real-world lighting. We're
going to make the simplest possible lighting setup. We want light to come from above (the positive
y axis). To accomplish this, fragments near the top of the point will be brighter (larger color
values), and fragments near the bottom of the point will be darker (smaller color values). Let's
make a value called `shade` that's larger at the top and smaller at the bottom, which will then be
multiplied into `color`.

	float shade = 0.5 + 0.6 * p.y;
	shade = clamp(shade, 0.0, 1.0);
	color *= shade;

I just chose the values `0.5` and `0.6` because I thought they looked nice. Generally we just want
`shade` to vary roughly between `0.0` and `1.0`. The `clamp` line assures that it remains within
that range. It's perfectly fine to assign values outside this range to `gl_FragColor`, in that it
won't cause errors, but you'll get some weird effects.

## Exercises

1. Change the vertex shader so that the cube rotates vertically rather than horizontally.
1. Change the line that involves rotation around the vertical axis to
`gamepos.xz *= R(rotation * float(index.y));`. This means that the amount a point is rotated around
the vertical axis depends on its y-coordinate. What do you expect it to look like?
1. Change the position of the light source. Instead of the scene being lit from the top, make it lit
from the left.
1. Change the definition of `shade` to `0.5 + dot(p, vec2(0.3, 0.5))`. Where do you think the light
will appear to come from?
1. Put a round hole in the middle of each point. Hint: you can do this by `discard`ing when you're
within a certain distance of the center of the point.
1. Change the definition of `shade` in the fragment shader to `0.5 + 0.6 * cos(10.0 * p.y);`
Try out some of the other bulit-in function other than `cos` and see if you can make any other weird
lighting effects.
1. Add the following line to the fragment shader, after the definition of `color`:
`color *= 0.5 + 0.4 * sin(10.0 * rotation + float(index.y));` This causes points to be brighter or
darker depending on the time and their y-coordinate. In order to get this to work, you'll need to
define `rotation` as a uniform variable in the fragment shader, as well as the vertex shader.
Remember that the precision has to match, and the default precision in the fragment shader is
`mediump`.
