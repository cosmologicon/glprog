# Lesson 11

Like drawing lines, when it comes to drawing triangles, there are three possible arguments you can
pass to `gl.DrawArrays`. They are `gl.TRIANGLES`, `gl.TRIANGLE_FAN`, and `gl.TRIANGLE_STRIP`. The
simplest, and also the most general, is `gl.TRIANGLES`.


You've now seen all seven possible "mode" arguments that can be passed to `gl.DrawArrays`. The other
two arguments are the starting index, and the count. Remember that the count is always the number of
different vertex attribute values will be drawn over, and also the number of parallel invocations of
the vertex shader that will be called. However, the number of objects that appear will depend on the
mode you use.

mode | to draw.... | set count to...
-----|-------------|----------------
`gl.POINTS` | 100 points | 100
`gl.LINES` | 100 line segments | 200
`gl.LINE_STRIP` | 100 line segments | 101
`gl.LINE_LOOP` | 100 line segments | 100
`gl.TRIANGLES` | 100 triangles | 300
`gl.TRIANGLE_FAN` | 100 triangles | 102
`gl.TRIANGLE_STRIP` | 100 triangles | 102
